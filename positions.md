We are always on a lookout for talented and motivated students or junior researchers to join our ranks.
If our research caught your interest, and your skills fit the focus of the group, feel free to drop 
me an [email](/index.html). Include a brief description of why you are interested in joining us, and your CV.
Please have a look [here](/research.html) at an (incomplete) list of examples of available projects.
We also welcome students with their own project ideas, as long as they are aligned with the 
resarch focus of the group.

Currently, *we do not have fully funded positions available*, however, below is a list of funding 
possibilities that you could pursue:

### PhD funding

* The PhD program of Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of Charles University. Any student that 
passes the entrance exam can be enrolled in this *funded* PhD program. A successful candidate can 
expect an equivalent of gross income of approximatly 1050 euros per month. Once living costs are taken into account, this allows for comfortable living arrangements
in Prague. For more details contact 
[me](/index.html). Additional funding schemes, such as teaching, mobility grants, 
or intra-university project grants allow for further increases of the salary.

### Post-docotral fellow funding

* Charles University is making yearly calls for [visting post-doctoral fellows](https://cuni.cz/UKEN-178.html), 
that come with 2 year contracts and attractive salary.

* The Faculty of Mathematics and Physics makes calls for visiting post-doctoral fellows with similar conditions. These calls are irregular, contact
me for the current status.

* We can help you write a project for the [Marie Skłodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/individual-fellowships_en).
